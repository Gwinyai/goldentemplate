# General Rules

## Scope
- Entire repository

## Goals
- Keep the golden template small, consistent, and easy to customize via a generator.
- Make all visual styling derive from `src/design-tokens.ts` and Tailwind config.
- Keep integration code isolated and safe when not configured.

## Rules

- Use **TypeScript** everywhere (`.ts` / `.tsx`) with strict settings.
- Prefer **Next.js App Router** conventions:
  - Use route groups `(public)`, `(protected)`, `(protected)/admin` as defined by the file structure.
  - Use `route.ts` for API endpoints under `app/api/**`.
- Do not introduce additional UI libraries beyond:
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Shadcn UI components in `components/ui/*`
- Avoid hardcoding:
  - Hex colors
  - Font names
  - URLs that should live in config (`lib/config/site.ts`, env variables).
- When adding new features:
  - Prefer creating small, focused components in `components/*`.
  - Prefer configuration in `lib/config/*` instead of inline literals spread across pages.
- Keep **generator-awareness**:
  - Any value that should be customizable by the generator should use a clearly named placeholder or live in a config file.
  - Do not move or rename core files (`src/design-tokens.ts`, `lib/config/site.ts`, `lib/config/features.ts`, `lib/integrations/*`) without updating the generator expectations.
