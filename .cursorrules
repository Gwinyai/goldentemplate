# VibeGuide Golden Template - Cursor Rules

This project uses modular cursor rules organized in the `.cursor/rules/` directory:

- `general.mdc` - Repository-wide conventions and Next.js patterns
- `design-tokens.mdc` - Design system and theming guidelines  
- `routing.mdc` - Route group conventions and auth guards
- `backend-and-integrations.mdc` - Server actions, API routes, and integrations
- `config-and-env.mdc` - Configuration and environment variable management

Please refer to the individual `.mdc` files in `.cursor/rules/` for detailed guidelines.

## Quick Reference

- Always use design tokens from `src/design-tokens.ts`
- Follow route group patterns: `(public)`, `(protected)`, `(protected)/admin`
- Keep integrations in `lib/integrations/*` with safe fallbacks
- Use placeholder values like `__VG_BRAND_NAME__` for generator replacement
- Implement user mutations as server actions, webhooks as API routes
